Tools in Data Science Course Content

Week 1: Introduction to Data Science Tools
Data science is a multidisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. The key tools include Python, R, SQL, and various libraries.

Python Basics:
- Python is a high-level programming language widely used in data science
- Key libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
- Installation: Use anaconda or pip package manager
- Jupyter notebooks are commonly used for interactive development

SQL Fundamentals:
- Structured Query Language for database operations
- Essential commands: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
- Joins: INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER
- Aggregation functions: COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN

Week 2: Data Collection and Web Scraping
Data collection methods include APIs, web scraping, databases, and file imports.

Web Scraping:
- BeautifulSoup library for HTML parsing
- Requests library for HTTP requests
- Ethics and legal considerations
- Rate limiting and respectful scraping

APIs:
- REST API fundamentals
- JSON data format
- Authentication methods: API keys, OAuth
- Python requests library for API calls

Week 3: Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
Data cleaning is crucial for accurate analysis.

Common Data Issues:
- Missing values: handle with imputation or removal
- Duplicates: identify and remove
- Outliers: detect using statistical methods
- Data type inconsistencies

Pandas Operations:
- DataFrame manipulation

Assignment Guidelines and Common Questions:

Q1: Which AI model should I use for the course assignments?
A: For the TDS course assignments, you must use gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 as specified in the assignment requirements, even if other models like gpt-4o-mini are available through AI proxies. This ensures consistency in evaluation.

Q2: How do I handle token counting for API usage?
A: Use a tokenizer similar to what Prof. Anand demonstrated in lectures. Count the tokens in your input text and multiply by the given rate to calculate costs. The tiktoken library is recommended for OpenAI models.

Q3: What's the difference between different evaluation methods?
A: The course covers multiple evaluation approaches:
- Holdout validation (train-test split)
- Cross-validation (k-fold)
- Time series split for temporal data
- Stratified sampling for imbalanced datasets

Q4: How to handle missing data in assignments?
A: Follow the three-step approach:
1. Identify the type of missingness (MCAR, MAR, MNAR)
2. Choose appropriate handling method (deletion, imputation, or modeling)
3. Document your decision and its impact on results

Q5: Best practices for data visualization?
A: Follow these guidelines:
- Choose appropriate chart types for your data
- Use clear labels and titles
- Consider color accessibility
- Avoid chart junk and unnecessary decorations
- Tell a story with your visualizations

Common Errors and Solutions:
- ImportError: Install required packages using pip or conda
- Memory errors: Use chunking or sampling for large datasets
- Convergence issues: Check data scaling and algorithm parameters
- Validation errors: Ensure proper data splitting and preprocessing
